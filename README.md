This is a program that I made this years that implements some basic PANDAS functions to manupulate data.

This program reads in a .CSV file which is linked to my drive. It then has 2 functions that use the dataset.

  Find() allows the user to ask for all of the values of an entry of a particular type.
  Count() allows the user to ask how many individuals have the values of an entry of a particular type.
  
  The program accepts 3 inputs at the start:
    (1), (2), and (3). Any other input will do nothing.
    It then will guide the user with prompts for the find() function or count() function.
